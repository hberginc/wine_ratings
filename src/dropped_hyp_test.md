Those rating the wines 

    * Null Hypothesis: Wines that are less than the median rating have a the same length descriptions as wines with points above the median.
    * Alternative Hypothesis: Wines that are higher than the median rating have longer descriptions than the wines with lower ratings.

    Once finding a p_value of exactly 0. I can certainly conclude that the rating value is connected to having longer descriptions.

    The visual above shows a clear connection between the rating and the length of the description as well as the drastic variations in description length. 



4. Similar to the third hypothesis, I wondered if the reverse concept was true. 
    Null Hypothesis: Wines that have fewer than the median number of words in the description no difference in ratings ratings than those with longer descriptions. 
    Alternative Hypothesis: Wines that have greater than the median number of words in the description have higher ratings.

    Using this similar hypothesis, I found a p_value of exactly 0. The length of the description is correlated with having higher reviews.
