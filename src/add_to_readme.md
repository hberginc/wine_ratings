4. Similar to the third hypothesis, I wondered if the reverse concept was true. 
    Null Hypothesis: Wines that have fewer than the median number of words in the description no difference in ratings ratings than those with longer descriptions. 
    Alternative Hypothesis: Wines that have greater than the median number of words in the description have higher ratings.

    Using this similar hypothesis, I found a p_value of exactly 0. The length of the description is correlated with having higher reviews.
